# Clone Another Repository, Make Changes, and Create a New Pull Request

The best way to become and stay familiar with Git is, as with so many things, is to practice!  Here's a challenge to help you *and* someone else improve your Git skills.  Use what you learned to:

1. Clone a branch from someone else's GitHub repository to your local Git repository.
2. Create your own local branch for the repository.
3. Make changes to your local copy of the repository within your new branch.
4. Stage, commit, and push your local changes to the source repository.
5. Create a merge request and wait for the repository owner to merge your changes.
6. Pull the merged changes into your local Git repository.
