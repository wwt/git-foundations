# Stage, Commit, &, Push New Changes to GitHub



From your terminal, push your changes to GitHub with the following command:



```shell
git push
```

Log on to https://github.wwt.com (ATC VPN required)
Open your Git repository
From the home screen, your repository list is on the left
Make sure you are in the branch, 'Branch3'
You can use the 'Branch:' button to choose the correct branch

Notice the 'myScript.py' file exists in GitHub, but only in 'Branch3'
If you change to any other branch, you will not see 'myScript.py'
Make sure you return to 'Branch3' before continuing

Click the 'Commits' link on the left side of the header
Notice all of your individual/atomic commits
Even though the 'git push' command pushes all commits at once, commits remain separate
