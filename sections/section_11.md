# Pull/Merge Changes on GitHub



Log on to https://github.wwt.com (ATC VPN required)
Open your Git repository
From the home screen, your repository list is on the left

Locate and click the green, 'Compare & pull request' button in the header

Review the 'Open a pull request' page and observe the following:
The pull request defaults to merging your current branch (Branch3) to 'master'
You may use the text input boxes to assign a title and comments to your pull request
You may use the fields on the right side of the page to assign reviewers/assignees
Presumably, someone would review your changes before merging the changes
You may review the commits, changed files, and contributors at the bottom of the page

Locate and click the green, 'Create pull request' button below the text input boxes
The ensuing page will give you a final opportunity to review changes

Locate and click the green, 'Merge pull request' button to start the merge
Click the 'Confirm merge' button to complete the merge
You will see messages which read:
'Pull request successfully merged and closed'
'You’re all set—the Branch3 branch can be safely deleted'

Click the 'Delete branch' to close the pull request and remove 'Branch3'
