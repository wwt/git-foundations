# Clone Another Repository, Make Changes, and Create a New Pull Request

:100: The best way to become and stay familiar with Git is, as with so many things, to practice! Here's a challenge to help you _and_ someone else improve your Git skills. Use what you learned to:

1. Clone someone else's GitHub repository to your local development/Git environment.

2. Create your own local branch in the cloned repository.

3. Make changes to your local copy of the Git repository, within your new branch.

4. Stage, commit, and push your local changes to the GitHub repository.

5. Create a pull request and wait for the repository owner to merge your changes.

6. Pull the merged changes into your local Git repository.
